# Grid and sub grid tutorial
tutorial can be found here, but the main idea is to be able to create Grid components and allow its children to also be grid componets.

The issue that this tries to solve is when we have grids, only the parent divs are styled, but its children do not behave as grid.
grid children are not linked between themselves and subgrid solves that problem.
The image below shows the use can when you need to use subgrid
